This game is inspired by "red light, green light"

It should be made with HTML and Javascript.  Put the files in the docs folder as it will be hosted with Github Pages.  Please make the canvas play area as large as the browser window.

I want 50 "players" one of which will be human controlled with WASD.  The others will be AI controlled.

All players will start on the LEFT side of the screen behind a dashed line.  The goal is to make it to the RIGHT side of the screen past another dashed line.  There should be a red/green bar around the play area that will transition from red to green and back to red.  The bar will transition at a random interval between 2 and 5 seconds.  When the bar is green, players can move.  When the bar is red, players cannot move.  

If any player moves when the light is red, they are "shot" by snipers.  The AI controlled players should be pretty good, but each round should have at least several players die and get "shot."

The players should NOT be able to clip inside each other - they should be "solid."

Make the AI controlled players a dark green circle.  Make the human player dark green circle but with a white outline.
